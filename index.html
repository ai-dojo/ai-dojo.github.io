<div id="teaching-philosophy" class="section">
    <h2> Our teaching method</h2>
    <h3> We train your team in intensive sessions of a few consecutive days. Here's how we make sure that the AI Dojo is a calm and immersive place for learning:</h3>

    <details id="tailored" open="open">
        <summary><em class="highlight">Tailored to your needs</em></summary>

        <p>We'll discuss with you beforehand exactly what you and your team want to get out of the training.
            We know that teams members often have diverse technical
            backgrounds, and we'll make sure that everybody finds their place in the Dojo.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><em>Immersive Learning</em></summary>
        <p>We'll make sure that you know the essentials to get started,
            but really, the best way to learn is to just dive in and try things out.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><em>Code examples and live coding</em></summary>
        <p>Code examples are a great way for immersing oneself in the material.
            We'll walk you through examples that showcase important concepts — and we'll run and modify them live,
            too.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><em>Hands-on exercises</em></summary>
        <p> We'll form smaller groups that work on smaller
            exercises together. The trainers check in with each group regularly to make sure that no one is stuck.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><em>Conversations with experts</em></summary>
        <p> Questions and discussions are encouraged at any point during the
            training. Your trainers have spent many years building AI solutions for clients and are happy to share their
            knowledge
            (and perhaps some anecdotes here and there).</p>
