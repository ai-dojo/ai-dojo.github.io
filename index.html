    <h1> Relax, we've got you :-) </h1>
    <p>Learn AI and data science in a calm and immersive atmosphere. </p>

    <p>We'll devise a training program, <i>just right for you</i>. Or, you can choose from one of the
        <a href="#previous-trainings">existing programs</a> we have built for happy customers.

    <h1> Our teaching method</h1>
    <p><i> Here's how we make sure that the AI Dojo is a calm and immersive place for learning:</i></p>
    <p><span class="intro-para">Tailored to your needs</span> We'll discuss with you beforehand exactly what you
        and your team want to get out of the training. We know that teams members often have diverse technical
        backgrounds, and we'll make sure that everybody finds their place in the Dojo.
    </p>
    <p><span class="intro-para">Keep presentations to a minimum.</span>
        We'll make sure that you know the essentials to get started,
        but really, the best way to learn is to just dive in and try things out.</p>
    <p><span class="intro-para">Code examples</span> are a great way for immersing oneself in the material. We'll
        walk you through examples that showcase important concepts — and we'll run and modify them live, too.
    </p>
    <p><span class="intro-para">Hands-on Exercises</span> We'll form smaller groups that work on smaller exercises
        together. The trainers check in with each group regularly to make sure that no one is stuck.
    </p>
    <p><span class="intro-para">Q&A</span> Questions and discussions are encouraged at any point during the training.
        Your trainers have spent many years building AI solutions for clients and are happy to share their knowledge
        (and perhaps some anecdotes here and there).
